# eSpeak-Sapi-5-Installer
eSpeak NG is a continuation of the eSpeak voices. It is an open source voice library that can be found here https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng installing there MSI gives only the English voice but the package actually contains lots more voices. I tried to build an XML file that would allow for installation of all the voices.

# Success
    all voices show up here: Control Panel\Ease of Access\Speech Recognition -> text to speech

# Failure
    using the speaking test in control panel (Control Panel\Ease of Access\Speech Recognition -> text to speech) causes them to speak until the last syllable. (so if theres only 1 it doesn't speak)
    using the voices in chrome (claroread chrome extention / speechsynthesis) will cause them to say "slash" in the respective language at the end of every input.
